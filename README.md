# Stochastic interpolants

This is a minimal implementation of some concepts related to stochastic interpolants in JAX, based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08797) by Michael S. Albergo, Nicholas M. Boffi, Eric Vanden-Eijnden.


**Disclaimer:**
This implementation is meant to be didactic.
For a more functional version (in Pytorch) see the repository published by the authors of the paper [here](https://github.com/malbergo/stochastic-interpolants).



## Installation

Move to the root of the directory, and run

```
pip install .
```

Then, find the content as 
```
from stochint import *
```

## Demonstrations

Find the demos in `demos/`.
